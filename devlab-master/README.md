Getting Started
==========================
1. Signup for an [M2X Account](https://m2x.att.com/signup).
2. Obtain your _Master Key_ from the Master Keys tab of your [Account Settings](https://m2x.att.com/account) screen.
3. Create your first [Data Source Blueprint](https://m2x.att.com/blueprints) and copy its _Feed ID_.
4. Review the [M2X API Documentation](https://m2x.att.com/developer/documentation/overview).
5. Consult the [M2X Getting Started guide](https://m2x.att.com/developer/get-started) for more detailed information.

### Setting up your first M2X data source

You will need an [AT&T M2X](https://m2x.att.com/) API key and a Data Source Feed ID. If you don't have an API key, create an account and, once registered and with your account activated, create a new [Data Source Blueprint](https://m2x.att.com/blueprints), and set aside the `Feed ID` and `API Key` values for later use.
